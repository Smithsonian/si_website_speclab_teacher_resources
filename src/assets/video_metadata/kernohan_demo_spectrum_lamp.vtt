<v ->For this demonstration, I have a vertical</v>

2
00:00:01.445 --> 00:00:04.448 line:15% 
filament light bulb connected to a variable power supply.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.320
And the first thing, I have it nice and bright.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.990
And say, you see this, these students,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.380
you see this as white, but what is it really?

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.630
And through the diffraction grating,

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.490
they can see the spectra on either side,

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.460
and say, it's not white, it's red, green, yellow

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.140
on all the colors there.

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.850
So that there's no such thing as white.

11
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.770
It's just what you perceive.

12
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.100
And then I say, what's causing

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.090
these electromagnetic waves are things that are vibrating.

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.253
If you have a charge, that's vibrating.

15
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.460
The more often it vibrates,

16
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.550
the higher frequency creates an electromagnetic wave.

17
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.640
If it's vibrating less often, that's a longer wavelength,

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.260
a lower frequency.

19
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.960
And that vibrating is related to temperature.

20
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
So if it's hot like this, this thing is giving off light

21
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.250
because it's hot.

22
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.430
So if you turn the temperature down,

23
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.040
and you're looking through the diffraction grading,

24
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.040
right around here, I can still see the red and the green,

25
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.323
but the blue and the violet is pretty much gone.

26
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.990
So it's not hot enough

27
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.840
to give off those higher frequencies.

28
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.910
And then you can make it even colder.

29
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.010
And now it's giving off pretty much orangey

30
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.690
or just red light.

31
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.370
And then I say, well, is it giving off light now?

32
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.600
And the answer is yes.

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.720
It's just that it's not visible light that we can perceive.

34
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.520
It's infrared light.

35
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.580
How do we see things we can't see?

36
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.300
So if we have a long wavelength like infrared light,

37
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.470
can we detect that?

38
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.353
And the answer is yes, if you have a cell phone.

39
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.200
And here I have just a remote

40
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.290
and if I'm just push a button, you can see it flashing.

41
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.220
Can you see it flashing?

42
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.020
I hope it's flashing.

43
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.020
You can't see it here, but you can see it here.

44
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.170
So this camera detects infrared light.

45
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.183
Now this is a Android phone.

46
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.920
Apple phones don't do it nearly as well or if at all.

47
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.710
But yeah, so you can see infrared light.

48
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.900
And to detect ultraviolet light,

49
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.980
we would have some either glow in the dark material

50
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.380
or tonic water.

51
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.330
You shine ultraviolet light through it,

52
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.870
and you can see a nice pinky glow.

53
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.350
The quinine, is what I understand, is reacting

54
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.030
with the ultraviolet light here.

55
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.800
And here is just the tap water.

56
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.580
I don't see, I see it hitting the straw there,

57
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.850
but I don't see the beam in the water here

58
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.413
as much as I do here.

59
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.970
Oh, or another example for ultraviolet light is anything

60
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.090
that is fluorescent like this.

61
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.280
You can see it's reacting to the light.

62
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.440
And I have students take out their highlighters

63
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.030
and look at the highlighters.

64
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.730
There are certain fluorescent yellow markers that,

65
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.970
in the ultraviolet light, it just pops.

66
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.140
And that's why you want that for your highlighting.

67
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.412
'Cause it actually emits light.

68
00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:15.912
(upbeat music)

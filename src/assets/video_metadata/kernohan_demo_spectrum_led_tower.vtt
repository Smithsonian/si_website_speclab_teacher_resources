00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.980
<v ->Later on, we'll get off</v>

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.943 line:15% 
to just an LED tower.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.280
These things are giving off light,

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.780
not because they're hot,

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.440
but there's a different reaction going on inside there.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.000
So these things are relatively cool.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.784
You can get whatever wavelength you want.

8
00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:24.690
(students chattering in distance)

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.750
So then I have the students looking at this

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.260
<v ->or even their cell phones -</v>

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.120
through the diffraction grating.

12
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.228
And they can see anything that's white

13
00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:38.085
is really only red, green, and blue

14
00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:41.823
that they don't have an infinite number of

15
00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:43.470
lights inside there.

16
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.303
There's only the three.

17
00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:45.720
And then I talk a little bit about

18
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.047
the biology of why or how your eye works.

19
00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:52.380
(upbeat music)
